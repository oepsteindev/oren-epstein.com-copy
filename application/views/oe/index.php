										"I have spent a great deal of time working with Oren over the years. During the 17 years I partnered in a computer services and application development company, I relied on him continuously because he is knowledgeable, dependable, organized, and as I'm fond of saying, "do it like you mean it" which he does.
<br><br>
Our projects ranged in scope from website development to application development using many design tools and technologies (PHP/MySQL, MSSQL and typical Microsoft development technologies, the Adobe products including Cold Fusion, HTML and CSS, rapid application development environments, modern frameworks, even one-off plugins written by non-english-speaking programmers.) From solo work, to team programming, to individual component development, he delivered exactly what was required. 
<br><br>
Over time our workflow evolved to include his attendance at development meetings with new clients in order to increase efficiency, and as a way to redirect clients to a better (possibly more realistic) approach to a solution. In meetings, Oren was professional, and despite the many different personalities and varying technological proficiency we encountered, he handled the clients expertly.
<br><br>
He was a pleasure to work with, and perhaps more importantly as a business owner, Oren's involvement with a project meant less stress for me."

	<strong>Rodney A Steiner, Senior Engineer</strong>, <a href="http://www.directnic.com">DirectNIC</a><br><br>
	"I have had the pleasure of working with Oren for almost three years. During this time, I have collaborated with him on numerous projects ranging from straightforward bug fixes to complex systems design and implementation. Over the course of my 22 year career as a software engineer, I have learned both the value and rarity of a developer who can work autonomously on a project while also working as part of a team. Oren is such a developer. He has solid technical skills that I have personally seen with PHP and MySQL. More importantly, he has a fundamental knowledge of general software engineering, problem solving and the development life cycle. Due to this foundational knowledge, I would not have any reservations relying on him to learn a new technology and implement it in a project. He learns quickly and adapts well when a project has rapidly evolving needs. When we collaborated, I was never concerned about the quality or timeliness of his submissions. I would like to strongly recommend Oren to anyone who has need of his skills. You will be pleased with his technical skills, work ethic, general affability and ability to function as part of a cohesive team."

<li><strong>Michael Turner</strong>, Directnic.com, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-turner-8b94288/"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a><br><br>"While working with me, Oren wrote PHP using MySQL and various frontend enabling tools such as Javascript, &amp; CSS. We worked together on a variety of tasks, including troubleshooting and code maintenance as well as code development in PHP. I was particularly impressed with his knowledge of SQL and DB generally. I&#39;d hire Oren in a heartbeat, given the chance. "   </li>

										<li><strong>Laurie Stogniew</strong>, Executive Director of Marketing,Sebring Management<br><br>
										"Oren Epstein has shown me what a fantastic website developer really is.  I have worked with several dozen freelance web developers in the past 10 years and feel I have now found the best!  Oren delivered almost instant response time to questions and offered a plethora of knowledge on all current and web related topics. His Word Press training was top notch and extremely thorough.  We worked well together and at the end of the day, Oren delivered a prodigious final product two weeks ahead of schedule! Did I mentioned he was fun to work with too? "  </li>
									<li><strong>Jonathan Bast</strong><a href="www.magneticmarketing.me" target="_blank">, Magnetic Marketing</a><br><br>
"As a provider of PPC advertising, I encountered Oren through a mutual client. As most PPC providers probably know, dealing with third party website management can typically be a hassle trying to get them to place tracking codes on a clients website. With our client wanting to get their campaign running next day, I thought for sure we wouldn't launch for another week. She emailed Oren and Oren has been the most responsive website controller I have dealt with. I appreciate the great service Oren has provided and will recommend him to fellow colleagues.
